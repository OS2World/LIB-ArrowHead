Hello -- welcome to the ArrowHead library for OS/2

I needed to draw arrowheads one day, so I whipped this up.
The header file should be all the explanation you need.
The arrowheads are drawn with the current GPI attributes
of the given hps.

If this library saves you lots of time and money, please
send some of that (U.S $10.00 to be precise) to

         David Kopp
         705 Anderson Circle
         Madison, AL  35758

Also, if you are using this, please drop me a note at

         102773,114@CompuServe.com

Thanks.

P.S.  There should also be a WIN32 version floating around.
      If you can't find it, you should be able to port this
      version without too many problems.
